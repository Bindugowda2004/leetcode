#Brute Force Approach (two_sum_bruteforce)

def twoSum(nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]


#HashMap Approach (two_sum_hashmap)

def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        diff = target - num
        if diff in seen:
            return [seen[diff], i]
        seen[num] = i
